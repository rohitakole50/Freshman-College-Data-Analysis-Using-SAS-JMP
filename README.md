# Freshman-College-Data-Analysis-Using-SAS-JMP

## Overview:

This project involves a comprehensive analysis using multiple linear regression techniques on the Freshman College Dataset. The goal is to understand the relationships between various predictors and the first-year retention rate. The analysis includes building regression models, interpreting the results, and identifying key predictors. SAS JMP software is used for the statistical analysis.

## Objectives:

* To build and interpret multiple linear regression models for the Freshman College dataset.
* To identify significant predictors and understand their relationships with the first-year retention rate.
* To use visualizations and statistical metrics to evaluate the models and interpret the results.

## Key Components:

### 1. Dataset Description:

The dataset includes predictors such as high school GPA, ACT scores, and freshman college GPA.

### 2. Analysis:

* Created multiple regression models, identified and dropped statistically insignificant predictors, and evaluated the final model to determine the best predictor for first-year retention rate.
* Used visualizations such as scatter plots and regression lines to illustrate the relationships between variables.

### 3. Key Findings:

* Freshman college GPA is identified as the best predictor for the first-year retention rate.
* The final model shows a positive correlation between freshman college GPA and retention rate.

## Tools and Technologies:

* SAS JMP software for data analysis and visualization.
* Microsoft Word for documenting the analysis and findings.

## Conclusion:

The Freshman College Data Analysis project demonstrates the application of multiple linear regression techniques to explore and understand the factors influencing first-year retention rates. Through various models and analyses, the project provides valuable insights into the key predictors of student retention.
